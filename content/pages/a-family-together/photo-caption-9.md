GÃ©nesis (left) and Jonelle wait in the hallway to see if there is any room left in the inquilinato for them to spend the night. An inquilinato is a small shelter where people can pay for a small room on a nightly basis. The hallways are dimly lit and reveal bare wires, cracked walls and copious amounts of dirt. The small rooms each come with a twin mattress, small nightstand, dresser and black and white box TV that usually takes a few firm hits to get functional.
