GÃ©nesis (near left) and Yuneda (back left) count out how many pieces of candy to sell to a man who stopped to give them money. They are not technically selling candy because they would need a vending license. Instead people give them donations and they offer small candy as a thank you in return. Some people choose to take the candy while others are happy to simply help.
