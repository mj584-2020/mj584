Michael Sanchez holds up a sign reading, "Hola Amigos somos Venezolanos en busca de un mejor futuro. pueden colaborarnos con algo comida o dinero estariamos muy agradecidos dios les bendiga y les multiplique. 'Amen' Gracias." This translates to "Hi, we are Venezuelans in search of a better future. can you help us with some food or money we would be very grateful god bless you and multiply on you. 'Amen', thanks." He does this while sitting on a bench near San Antonio metro station that was marked as the family's "home base" for the day as they split up to try and make enough money to afford a place to sleep at night.
