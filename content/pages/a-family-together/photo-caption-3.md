GÃ©nesis Moreno (back, middle) attempts to sell small candies while Yuneda Nelo (front, left) and Michael Sanchez (front, middle) talk about where to stand to best make money. At the same time Carlos Gabedes (near right) and Jonelle Gabedes (far right), count their money to see how much they will need to make that day to afford a small room for the five of them to sleep in that night. Carlos splits from the group completely each day to sell candy at an intersection in a different region of the city, Poblado, in hopes of bringing in additional income.
