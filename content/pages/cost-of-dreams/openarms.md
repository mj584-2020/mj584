                foreigners identification cards. When a Venezuelan child enters school in Colombia, it must be legally
                reported to immigration with official documentation. Because of this, many children do not pursue

                one for everyday use and another for physical education. Each school uniform costs around 42,000 pesos
                ($16.80 USD).<br><br>

                up to 30 minutes by foot. Along the border, children walk up to 6 miles each way across the Simón
                Bolívar bridge from Venezuela to Colombia, and each trip takes about 2 hours. </div>
