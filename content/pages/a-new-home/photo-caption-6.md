(From left) Yuneda Nelo, Jonelle Gabedes, Carlos Gabedes and Michael Sanchez sit in their small room they rented of the night in an inquilinato, a shelter where bare-bone furnished rooms are rented on a nightly basis. The building has dozens of rooms that are on a first-come, first-serve basis and are often destinations for Venezuelan migrants at night with no cheaper alternative. This family arrived in Medell√≠n only ten days before this photo was taken.
