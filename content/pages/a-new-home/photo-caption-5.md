Mar√≠angel Castillo holds her baby, Carla, as she looks out the window of her apartment that overlooks downtown. Mariangel, her husband and their two kids share a two bedroom apartment with another family. Each family has one bedroom to themselves and shares the common areas. She migrated from Venezuela and then returned to have her baby before coming back to Colombia because she wanted Carla to have Venezuelan citizenship.
