Deylena Barboza Chadin (middle), and her husband, Jonathan Freites Salazar, stand with their children (from left) Ver√≥nica, Luciano and Miranda on the roof of their apartment building. The family arrived two years ago and the parents have both made successful livings as a personal trainer and a soon-to-be lawyer. They live in a two bedroom apartment in a nicer part of the city.
