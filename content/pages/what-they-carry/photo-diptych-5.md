Jedrileth Carolina Gonzalez Roa and her boyfriend John Jairo Blandón Mejías sit together in their home in Medellín. Here they share a household with six other friends and family members, including Kiara, Jedrileth’s niece. They came to Colombia because they couldn’t face the situation in Venezuela anymore. “The situation is really dangerous. You go out of your house and you don’t know if you’ll come back. I’ll do anything to bring my family here,” Jedrileth said. In Caracas, she bought cups for her whole family, each with a special quote inside. The cups she and John hold in their hands are important because they remind her of her family and the good moments they had.
