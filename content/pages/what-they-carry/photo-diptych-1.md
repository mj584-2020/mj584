Kiara Antonella Fariñas Rodriguez migrated with her family from Maturín, Venezuela to Medellín in May 2018. Her family had no choice but to leave their home in Venezuela as the country fell deeper into the humanitarian crisis, and her family was unable to purchase basic supplies to take care of her. Kiara lives with eight people, including her mother and father Oneidys Alejandra Rodríguez Fuenmayor and Richard Javier Fariñas Herrera. The stuffed bunny she holds in her hands is one of the few items Kiara brought with her from home.
