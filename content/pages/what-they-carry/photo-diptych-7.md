Amalia Tarazona and her husband Juan Carlos sit in the bedroom of their apartment in Medellín. Juan Carlos works as a chef and a musician and often doesn’t finish working until five in the morning. He arrived in Colombia five years ago and Amalia came in 2017. “Even if the situation is fixed, and there were diamonds and gold and whatever back there, I still wouldn’t go there. We had some stuff back there and we had to sell everything,” said Juan Carlos, “but material things aren’t that important, what’s important is that we’re fine.” To continue his occupation of being a chef, Amalia and Juan Carlos brought with them their pepper grinder.
