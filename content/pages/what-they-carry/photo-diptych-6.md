Ayerim Galue and her daughter sit together at a mall in Medellín where her husband works. Her family came here in October 2018 for their two-year-old daughter Rebecca. During the recent rolling blackouts, Ayerim has been unable to eat because she couldn’t talk to her mother in Venezuela and wondered whether she was able to eat. Ayerim brought her grandmother’s dress with her from Venezuela, and especially treasures it as her grandmother raised her and recently passed away.
