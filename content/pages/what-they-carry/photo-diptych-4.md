Andrea Blanco Rondón sits on her bed with her children Lillian, Elisa and Andres. Andrea’s family came to Colombia from about two years ago when they were unable to buy basic necessities for their children. Before Medellín, they went to Cúcuta and sold candies and guava snacks. After a year, they saved money for bus tickets and came to Medellín. They live in the neighborhood Santo Domingo, a cable car’s ride away from the center of Medellín. The family feels grateful to be together and healthy in Colombia. Andrea brought a photograph of her grandmother.
