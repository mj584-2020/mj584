Maríangel Castillo lives in an apartment in Medellín with her two children and husband. They share this space with another family, but don’t mind it. Her husband came to Colombia before her, then she came for a few months before returning to Venezuela to give birth to her baby. She remained in Venezuela for one month then returned to Medellín. She holds in her hands a religious idol she brought as a way of remembering her family. It is a strong cultural piece from her home in Venezuela and each member of her family has one.
