Elizabeth Tarazona lives with her sister Amalia and her husband Juan Carlos. She arrived in July 2018 with her son, and has three children still in Anzoátegui where she is from. Elizabeth brought next to nothing with her to Medellín, and holds on to her memories as she dreams of returning to Venezuela someday. Though she and her sister are Colombian, they have lived in Venezuela for the last twenty years and consider it their home. “I feel more of a Venezuelan person than a Colombian. I only brought my memories from home and I have three reasons to go back,” Elizabeth said, referring to her children who remain in Venezuela.
