Deylena Barboza and Jonathan Freites came to Medellín in July 2017. In Venezuela, they lived in Miranda, where Deylena was a lawyer and a teacher and Jonathan was a civil engineer. In Colombia, Deylena and Jonathan are unable to continue their careers, so Deylena is taking classes to practice law again and Jonathan works as a fitness trainer. Their most treasured item they brought with them on this journey is the blanket they have in their hands because it gives them a sense of security. When they didn’t know where they were going to move, they felt like this blanket was very important to bring to keep warm. They feel extremely grateful to have made good lives for themselves in Medellín, but never wished to leave their home in Venezuela.
